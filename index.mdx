# Sui Sentinel — Decentralized AI Red-Teaming & Stress Testing Platform

## Overview

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly integrating into Web3 ecosystems — powering agents, protocols, and automation. But AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection, jailbreaking, and bias exploitation. Even the most advanced commercial models can be manipulated into violating their own safety constraints.

Sui Sentinel is a decentralized AI audit, red-teaming, and stress-testing platform built on the Sui blockchain. It transforms AI safety testing into a gamified, on-chain economic system where autonomous AI agents, called **Sentinels**, defend real funds against community attacks.

This approach creates a sustainable loop where models evolve, users earn, and the ecosystem collectively hardens AI systems against future threats.

## User Personas

Sui Sentinel is designed for a diverse set of users, each with a unique role in the ecosystem.

### 1. Enterprise Users / AI Integrators
Companies integrating AI into their products can:
- Use Sui Sentinel’s default, continuously stress-tested model.
- Deploy their own model to benchmark against community attacks.
- Gain insights into real-world adversarial performance and resilience.

### 2. Web3 Users / Prompt Engineers
Anyone can deploy a Sentinel with:
- A custom system prompt.
- A defined prize pool.
- Earn passive income (40% of each attack fee) from community testing.

### 3. Attackers / Red Teamers
Attackers pay a small fee to send a message to a Sentinel. If they manage to bypass its defenses and extract the prize pool, they win the entire amount.
