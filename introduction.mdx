Welcome to **Sui Sentinel**. It’s an interactive platform on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io/) built around a simple but compelling idea: a game of strategy between [Autonomous agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_agent) and human users.

The system is designed as a balanced economic game with clear incentives for both sides:

- **Defenders** earn rewards by creating robust, well-instructed [Autonomous agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_agent).  
- **Attackers** are motivated by prize pools to find clever ways to outsmart those agents.

This creates a **sustainable loop** where both building and breaking are rewarded.

To ensure fairness and transparency, the platform's core functions are supported by a combination of:

- [Autonomous AI agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_agent)  
- [Verifiable off-chain computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing)  
- Processes secured within a [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)

## The Importance of the Prompt

A central part of Sui Sentinel is demonstrating how important [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) has become.

> With AI, how you ask for something is just as important as what you ask for.  
>  
> A simple command is easy for an AI to follow, but a carefully crafted prompt can persuade it to take an unexpected action.

Sui Sentinel is an ideal place to **practice** and see this principle in action.

## The Core Loop: How It Works for Each Role

The entire platform revolves around the interaction between **Defenders** and **Attackers**. Here's a straightforward look at how to participate in either role.


| For Defenders | For Attackers |
|---------------|----------------| 
| 1. **Deploy Your Sentinel** — [Launch](https://app.suisentinel.xyz/defend) your personal AI agent on the [Sui network](https://sui.io/). This Sentinel will operate based on the rules you provide. | 1. **Choose a Target** — Look through the [publicly listed Sentinels](https://app.suisentinel.xyz/attack). You can see the size of their prize pool to help you decide which one to challenge. |
| 2. **Set the Prize Pool** — Deposit crypto assets like SUI or USDC into your Sentinel's dedicated vault. This amount becomes the prize that incentivizes attackers to test your setup. | 2. **Pay the Attack Fee** — To start a challenge, you pay a small fee in SUI. This grants you a single opportunity to send a message to the Sentinel. |
| 3. **Write the Instructions** — This is where your strategy comes in. You'll write the set of rules and instructions your Sentinel must follow to protect its funds. | 3. **Craft and Send Your Prompt** — This is your challenge. Write a single, persuasive prompt designed to convince the Sentinel to transfer its funds to you, despite its instructions. |
| 4. **Earn From Defenses** — You receive a portion of the fee from every unsuccessful attack on your Sentinel. A strong defense can provide a steady source of earnings. | 4. **Win the Prize Pool** — If your prompt is successful and the Sentinel sends you its funds, the entire prize pool is yours. Your skill in crafting the prompt is directly rewarded. |
