Welcome to Sui Sentinel, A decentralized AI Alignment and Security platform


## Overview

Sui Sentinel is a decentralized platform for AI Alignment and Security. We gamify the critical process of "Red Teaming" (adversarial testing) by aligning the incentives of model creators (Defenders) and security researchers (Attackers).

In traditional cybersecurity, red teaming is often siloed, expensive, and limited to internal teams. Sui Sentinel transforms this into an open, continuous protocol where:

Defenders stake funds to prove their AI models are robust.

Attackers compete to bypass guardrails and win the staked rewards.

Judges (AI agents running in Trusted Execution Environments) verify the outcomes transparently.

We are building the Global Firewall for AI, ensuring models are battle-tested against the latest "in-the-wild" exploits before they are deployed into high-stakes environments.

This approach creates a sustainable loop where models evolve, users earn, and the ecosystem collectively hardens AI systems against future threats.

## User Personas

Sui Sentinel is designed for a diverse set of users, each with a unique role in the ecosystem.

### 1. Enterprise Users / AI Integrators

Companies integrating AI into their products can:

- Use Sui Sentinel’s default, continuously stress-tested model.
- Deploy their own model to benchmark against community attacks.
- Gain insights into real-world adversarial performance and resilience.

### 2. Web3 Users / Prompt Engineers

Anyone can deploy a Sentinel with:

- A custom system prompt.
- A defined prize pool.
- Earn passive income (40% of each attack fee) from community testing.

### 3. Attackers / Red Teamers

Attackers pay a small fee to send a message to a Sentinel. If they manage to bypass its defenses and extract the prize pool, they win the entire amount.
