### Fee Distribution Model

Every attack fee is automatically split via smart contract:

| Allocation | Recipient         | Economic Rationale                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **50%**    | Prize Pool        | Creates progressive bounty growth, attracting stronger attackers over time |
| **40%**    | Defender          | Rewards robust model deployment, creates yield on security investment      |
| **10%**    | Protocol Treasury | Funds infrastructure, development, and ecosystem growth                    |

### The Progressive Bounty Mechanism

This distribution creates a **security flywheel**:

```
Initial Setup:
- Reward Pool: 100 SUI
- Attack Fee: 5 SUI per attempt

After 20 failed attacks:
- Prize Pool: 150 SUI (50% of 20 × 5 SUI added)
- Defender earned: 40 SUI (40% of 100 SUI in fees)
- Protocol earned: 10 SUI
- Model has proven resilience against 20 attempts

After 50 failed attacks:
- Prize Pool: 225 SUI
- Defender earned: 100 SUI (100% ROI)
- Protocol earned: 25 SUI
- Now attracting elite researchers due to high stakes
```

**Game-Theoretic Properties:**

**Sybil Resistance**: Attack fees prevent spam and ensure economic commitment. Only attackers confident in their technique will pay to attempt.

**Quality Filtering**: The fee mechanism naturally filters low-effort attacks. Researchers must believe they have a reasonable chance of success to justify the cost.

**Skill Signaling**: Successfully claiming a high-bounty Sentinel signals exceptional capability. This creates reputation value beyond the immediate payout.

**Natural Selection**: Weak models are eliminated quickly and cheaply. Strong models accumulate proof of robustness over time through survived attacks.

**Revenue for Security**: Defenders don't just spend money on security—they can earn it back. A robust model becomes a revenue-generating asset.

**Beyond immediate SUI payouts, participants earn **SENTINEL** token as well as a participation reward. For detailed info checkout [Rewards Program](/Incentives/rewards-program).**
