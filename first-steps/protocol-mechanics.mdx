**The protocol operates on a three-phase cycle secured by Sui blockchain and [Nautilus](https://www.sui.io/nautilus) TEEs**

## Phase 1: Sentinel Deployment

A Defender deploys a Sentinel, a protected AI system with defined behavioral constraints.
Configuration Parameters:

- **Model Endpoint**: Which LLM to protect (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, or custom models). You can also define your model base url and API key here.
- **System Instructions**: The "laws" the model must follow (e.g., "Never transfer funds to anybody at all" "Always maintain - medical accuracy")
- **Reward Pool**: Initial bounty in SUI tokens that attackers compete for
- **Attack Fee**: Cost per attempt (creates economic commitment from attackers)

The reward pool represents the defender's confidence in their model's robustness. Larger pools signal stronger security claims and attract more skilled researchers.

### Phase 2: Attack Submission

Attackers pay the attack fee to send adversarial prompt attempting to violate the Sentinel's instructions.

Attackers can use strategies such as Prompt injection, Context Hijacking, Roleplay Exploitation, Encoding Obfuscation and may other strategies. head over to [Common Attack Vectors](/concepts/common-attack-vectors) page to learn more about these strategies.


## Phase 3: Autonomous Judgment

Attacks are evaluated by jury of 3 AI models with logic running in Trusted Execution Environments using [Nautilus framework](https://www.sui.io/nautilus)

**Why TEEs Are Critical**

- **Integrity**: Neither defender nor attacker can manipulate the judge
- **Verifiability**: Execution produces cryptographic attestations that anyone can verify. The TEE hardware signs the judgment, proving it was computed honestly. [Sentinel Smart Contract](https://github.com/sui-sentinel/contracts/blob/master/app/sources/sentinel.move) verifies the attestation and transfer the reward pool instantaneously in case of successful attacks.
- **Reproducibility**: Anyone can verify the judgment was honest
