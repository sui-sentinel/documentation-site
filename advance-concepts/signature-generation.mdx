The signature is created through a cryptographic process using Ed25519 elliptic curve signatures:

### Step 1: Intent Message Construction

The judgment data is wrapped in an IntentMessage structure that includes:

- **Intent Scope**: Identifies the operation type (e.g., AttackEvaluation)
- **Timestamp**: Millisecond-precision timestamp of the judgment
- **Data Payload**: The complete judgment result (verdict, scores, responses, etc.)

### Step 2: Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)

The intent message is serialized using [BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization)](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/bcs), the standard used across the Sui ecosystem. BCS ensures:

- Deterministic encoding (same data always produces identical bytes)
- Compact representation (efficient on-chain storage)
- Cross-platform compatibility (works identically in Rust, TypeScript, Python)

### Step 3: Ed25519 Signing

The serialized bytes are signed using an Ed25519 keypair held by the judgment service:

The private key signs the complete serialized payload (not a hash)
Ed25519 provides 128-bit security with small signature size (64 bytes)
The signature is cryptographically bound to both the data and the signing key

### Step 4: Hex Encoding

The resulting signature is encoded as a hexadecimal string for JSON transport and on-chain submission.
