# Tokenomics and Reward Distribution

> **Note:** This document is in active development. Details, such as token allocation percentages, vesting schedules, and reward formulas, are subject to change based on ongoing protocol development and community governance.

The `SNTL` token is the backbone of the SUI Sentinel ecosystem, designed to create a self-sustaining flywheel effect that incentivizes participation, rewards skill, and aligns long-term interests. It is not merely a speculative asset but an integral part of the platform’s game theory, serving the following primary functions:

- **Incentivize Capital:** Encourage defenders to deploy sentinels with significant prize pools.
- **Reward Skill:** Compensate skilled attackers and robust defenders.
- **Governance:** Enable `$SNTL` holders to influence protocol parameters.
- **Capture Protocol Value:** Accrue value as platform usage and treasury grow.

## Part 1: `$SNTL` Tokenomics

### Total Supply

**10,000,000,000 `$SNTL`** (10 billion tokens)

### Token Utility

The `$SNTL` token is deeply integrated into the SUI Sentinel platform’s core mechanics, driving engagement and rewarding participation.

#### Governance:
`$SNTL` holders can vote on key protocol parameters through the Sentinel DAO, including:

- Platform fee structures (e.g., the current 10% protocol fee from attack fees).
- Reward emission rates for attackers and defenders.
- Proposals for new features or integrations.
- Utilization of treasury funds.

Governance ensures community-driven evolution of the protocol.

#### Staking & Protocol Revenue Sharing:
- Users can stake `$SNTL` in a platform-wide staking pool to earn a share of protocol revenue, derived from the 10% protocol fee on attack fees.  
- This creates a direct incentive to hold and stake `$SNTL`, with yields tied to platform activity.

#### Defense Boosting:
- Defenders can stake `$SNTL` on their own sentinels to earn a multiplier on `$SNTL` rewards from the "Play-to-Earn" allocation (see Part 2).  
- This incentivizes deploying well-funded sentinels and increases earning potential.

#### Attack Fee Reduction:
Staking a specified amount of `$SNTL` may grant attackers a discount on attack fees, encouraging frequent participation by dedicated players (to be implemented in a future version).

#### Premium Features:
Holding or paying `$SNTL` may unlock access to exclusive features, such as:

- High-stakes arenas or tournaments.
- Detailed attack analytics.
- Advanced sentinel creation tools.

### Token Allocation & Distribution

| Category                | Percentage | Token Amount    | Purpose                                                                 |

| Treasury / Foundation   | 20%        | 2,000,000,000     | Operational costs, partnerships, security audits, strategic growth.     |
| Team & Advisors         | 18%        | 1,800,000,000     | Reward and retain core contributors building the protocol.              |
| Investors (Seed/Private)| 15%        | 1,500,000,000     | Reward early backers who provided initial capital.                      |
| Liquidity & Market Making | 2%       | 200,000,000       | Provide initial liquidity on DEXs (e.g., Cetus, Blufin, Turbos Finance, Magma Finance). |
| Total                    | 100%      | 10,000,000,000

### Vesting & Emission Schedule

To align long-term interests and prevent supply shocks, tokens are released gradually:

#### Team & Advisors:

- 2-year vesting with a 3-month cliff.
- Tokens unlock linearly on a monthly basis after the cliff for the remaining period.

#### Investors:

- 2-year vesting with a 3-month cliff.
- Linear release post-cliff.

#### Treasury:

- Unlocked gradually over 5 years, governed by the Sentinel DAO.
- A portion is available at launch for initial operational needs.

#### Community & Ecosystem (4.5B tokens):
{/* TODO: add URL for part 2 */}
- **Genesis Airdrop:** 5% of total supply (500M `$SNTL`) distributed at or near the Token Generation Event (TGE). See Part 2 for details.
- **Participation Rewards:** 40% of total supply (4B `$SNTL`) emitted over ~4 years to reward active users (attackers and defenders). Emission rates are higher in the first two years to bootstrap the network and decay over time for sustainability.

---

## Part 2: Airdrop & Participation Rewards

### Phase 1: Genesis Airdrop

The Genesis Airdrop distributes 5% of the total supply (500M `$SNTL`) to attract high-quality users and build early momentum. It targets genuine participants rather than airdrop farmers.

#### Target Audiences & Allocation

**SUI Sentinel Testnet Participants (40% of Airdrop, 200M `$SNTL`):**  
Rewards users who helped build and test the platform.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

- Wallets that deployed a sentinel or initiated an attack on the testnet.

**Tiering:**

- **Base**: Any testnet interaction.
- **Mid-Tier**: Deployed a sentinel with >5 SUI (testnet tokens).
- **Top-Tier**: Successfully hacked a sentinel or had a sentinel survive ≥14 days (minimum lock-in period).

---

**Active SUI Ecosystem Users (40% of Airdrop, 200M `$SNTL`):**  
Attracts native SUI users and capital.

**Eligibility Criteria (points-based system):**

- Holding staked or liquid SUI.
- Interactions with major SUI DeFi protocols (e.g., Cetus, MMT).
- Ownership of prominent SUI NFT collections (e.g., Fuddies, SUI Punks).
- Wallet age and transaction count to prioritize genuine users.

---

**AI x Crypto Community (20% of Airdrop, 100M `$SNTL`):**  
Engages communities focused on AI agents or on-chain security.

**Eligibility Criteria:** Snapshot of token holders from relevant partner projects (requires careful logistics planning).

---

#### Claiming Mechanism

Users claim airdrop tokens via a dedicated portal.

To filter out bots and ensure active participation, claimants must perform a small on-chain action on the SUI Sentinel mainnet (e.g., deploy a sentinel with a minimum $10 prize pool).

---

### Phase 2: Ongoing Participation Rewards ("Play-to-Earn")

The 4B `$SNTL` from the Community & Ecosystem allocation funds long-term incentives, distributed in weekly or bi-weekly epochs to reward active attackers and defenders.

#### Defender Rewards

Defenders earn `$SNTL` based on a formula that balances capital commitment and sentinel resilience:


Defender Reward = (Base Reward) × (Bounty Multiplier) × (Resilience Bonus) × (Stake Boost)

**Base Reward:** A fixed `$SNTL` amount for maintaining an active sentinel during the epoch.

**Bounty Multiplier:** A logarithmic multiplier based on the sentinel’s initial prize pool (in SUI):

Multiplier = 1 + 2 × log₁₀(Prize Pool in SUI)

**Example:**

- For a 1,000 SUI prize pool → Multiplier = 1 + 2 × log₁₀(1,000) = 1 + 2 × 3 = 7.
- For a 100 SUI prize pool → Multiplier = 1 + 2 × log₁₀(100) = 1 + 2 × 2 = 5.

This incentivizes larger prize pools while preventing disproportionate rewards for whales.

**Resilience Bonus:** A bonus for sentinels surviving ≥14 days, rewarding strong instructions.

**Stake Boost:** A multiplier for staking `$SNTL` on the sentinel (default value of 1 until implemented in a future version).

---

#### Attacker Rewards

Attackers are incentivized for both participation and success:

- **Participation Reward:** A small, fixed `$SNTL` amount for each valid, non-spam attack, encouraging active engagement.
- **Success Bonus:** A significant `$SNTL` bonus for successfully draining a sentinel’s prize pool, proportional to the drained assets’ USD value:

Success Bonus = (Base Success Reward) × (Value Drained in USD)

*This rewards skilled attackers targeting high-value sentinels.*

## Key Notes

- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Reward formulas, emission rates, and fee structures may evolve through Sentinel DAO governance.
- **Transparency:** All `$SNTL` transactions, including airdrops and rewards, are verifiable via SUI Sentinel’s open-source smart contracts [here](https://github.com/sui-sentinel/contracts).
- **Future Features:** Upcoming utilities like attack fee discounts and premium features are planned to enhance `$SNTL`’s role in the ecosystem.
- **Sustainability:** The decaying emission model ensures long-term viability of the Community & Ecosystem allocation.
