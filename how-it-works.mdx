## Technology Stack

Sui Sentinel combines Web3 security primitives with AI verification and containment infrastructure to ensure trustless AI execution, auditable interactions, and verifiable outcomes for every red-teaming event.

- **Sui Blockchain**: Stores sentinel state, prize pools, and verified agent responses.
- **Nautilus**: Enables verifiable off-chain AI inference by signing each agent response within a secure environment.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Ensures that AI agents run securely in an isolated environment and cannot be tampered with.
- **ed25519 Signatures**: All agent responses are cryptographically signed and verifiable on-chain, proving the authenticity and integrity of the AI's actions.

This stack enables AI agents to autonomously manage on-chain funds with verifiable outcomes, setting a precedent for trustless, AI-driven economic systems across DeFi, gaming, and beyond.

## Why Build on Sui?

Sui’s object-centric architecture and high-throughput execution make it the ideal infrastructure for real-time AI testing and gamified economic interactions.

With parallelized transactions, low latency, and on-chain verifiability, Sui provides the perfect substrate for scalable, interactive AI security protocols. As a native protocol on Sui, SUI Sentinel benefits from its expanding user base and DeFi ecosystem, driving transaction volume, protocol revenue, and `$SNTL` token utility.
