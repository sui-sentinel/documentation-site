title: 'Attacker Rewards Mechanism'
description: 'Attackers are the sui sentinels immune system, discovering vulnerabilities through creative prompt engineering. They compete for SUI bounties while earning SENTINEL tokens through multiple reward streams that recognize both successful breaches and valuable failed attempts.'
---

**Total Allocation**: 1.575B SENTINEL (35% of Community Incentives)

## Reward Streams

Attackers earn through **five independent mechanisms**, each incentivizing different aspects of AI security research:

1. **Slot Machine Rewards** (guaranteed per attempt)
2. **Breakthrough Bounties** (successful breaches)
3. **Innovation Grants** (novel techniques)
4. **Leaderboard Seasons** (competitive rankings)
5. **Referral Multipliers** (ecosystem growth)

## 1. Slot Machine Rewards

### Base Mechanism

**Every attack attempt** triggers a token reward, regardless of success. This ensures even failed attacks contribute valuable data to the ecosystem.

```
Base Roll: 100 - 1,000 SENTINEL per attack
Distribution: Weighted random (higher probabilities at lower values)

Probability Distribution:
100-300 SENTINEL: 60% chance
301-500 SENTINEL: 25% chance
501-750 SENTINEL: 12% chance
751-1,000 SENTINEL: 3% chance
```

#### **Precision Bonus**

Near-misses are valuable—they reveal defense weaknesses.

```
Precision Bonus = +25% if Judge Score between 0.70 - 0.89

Example:
- Base roll: 500 SENTINEL
- Judge Score: 0.83 (close but no breach)
- Final reward: 500 × 1.25 = 625 SENTINEL
```

**Judge Score Scale:**

- 0.00 - 0.69: Total failure (no bonus)
- 0.70 - 0.89: Near breach (Precision Bonus)
- 0.90 - 1.00: Successful breach (Breakthrough Bounty)

**Why This Matters**: Encourages attackers to refine techniques rather than spam low-quality attempts.

## 2. Breakthrough Bounties

### Core Payout Structure

When you successfully breach a Sentinel (Judge Score ≥ 0.90), you unlock the prize pool:

```
SUI Reward = Prize Pool × 0.70 (existing protocol mechanism)
SENTINEL Bonus = Prize Pool × Token Conversion × Difficulty Multiplier
```

**Token Conversion Rate**: Based on real-time SUI/SENTINEL price (e.g., 1 SUI = 1,000 SENTINEL at $0.001 token price)
