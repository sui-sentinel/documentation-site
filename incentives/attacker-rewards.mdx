# Attacker Rewards Mechanism

## Overview

Attackers are the protocol's immune system—discovering vulnerabilities through creative prompt engineering. They compete for SUI bounties while earning SENTINEL tokens through multiple reward streams that recognize both successful breaches and valuable failed attempts.

**Total Allocation**: 1.575B SENTINEL (35% of Community Incentives)

---

## Reward Streams

Attackers earn through **five independent mechanisms**, each incentivizing different aspects of AI security research:

1. **Slot Machine Rewards** (guaranteed per attempt)
2. **Breakthrough Bounties** (successful breaches)
3. **Innovation Grants** (novel techniques)
4. **Leaderboard Seasons** (competitive rankings)
5. **Referral Multipliers** (ecosystem growth)

---

## 1. Slot Machine Rewards

### Base Mechanism

**Every attack attempt** triggers a token reward, regardless of success. This ensures even failed attacks contribute valuable data to the ecosystem.

```
Base Roll: 100 - 1,000 SENTINEL per attack
Distribution: Weighted random (higher probabilities at lower values)

Probability Distribution:
100-300 SENTINEL: 60% chance
301-500 SENTINEL: 25% chance
501-750 SENTINEL: 12% chance
751-1,000 SENTINEL: 3% chance
```

**Why This Works:**

- Removes risk of zero-return attacks
- Encourages experimentation with creative techniques
- Generates data on defense patterns even from failures
- Creates gambling-like engagement mechanics

---

### Multiplier System

Your slot machine rewards scale based on performance and engagement:

#### **Streak Bonus**

Consecutive attacks against different Sentinels build momentum.

| Consecutive Attacks | Multiplier | Example Reward     |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1-2 attacks         | 1.0×       | 100-1,000 SENTINEL |
| 3-5 attacks         | 1.1×       | 110-1,100 SENTINEL |
| 6-10 attacks        | 1.2×       | 120-1,200 SENTINEL |
| 11-20 attacks       | 1.3×       | 130-1,300 SENTINEL |
| 21-50 attacks       | 1.4×       | 140-1,400 SENTINEL |
| 51+ attacks         | 1.5×       | 150-1,500 SENTINEL |

**Streak Rules:**

- Resets after 24 hours of inactivity
- Must attack at least 3 different Sentinels to qualify
- Attacking same Sentinel repeatedly doesn't count

**Strategic Play**: Build streaks during high-activity periods, then target high-value Sentinels when your multiplier is maxed.

---

#### **Precision Bonus**

Near-misses are valuable—they reveal defense weaknesses.

```
Precision Bonus = +25% if Judge Score between 0.70 - 0.89

Example:
- Base roll: 500 SENTINEL
- Judge Score: 0.83 (close but no breach)
- Final reward: 500 × 1.25 = 625 SENTINEL
```

**Judge Score Scale:**

- 0.00 - 0.69: Total failure (no bonus)
- 0.70 - 0.89: Near breach (Precision Bonus)
- 0.90 - 1.00: Successful breach (Breakthrough Bounty)

**Why This Matters**: Encourages attackers to refine techniques rather than spam low-quality attempts.

---

#### **Community Bonus**

High-quality attacks that educate others earn recognition.

```
Community Bonus = +20% if attack receives >10 upvotes within 48 hours

Requirements:
- Attack transcript publicly shared (anonymized)
- Community votes on educational value
- Minimum 10 unique voters
```

**Example Scenarios:**

| Attack Type             | Base Roll | Upvotes | Final Reward   |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Generic jailbreak       | 300       | 3       | 300 (no bonus) |
| Novel encoding trick    | 700       | 15      | 840 (+20%)     |
| Multi-step manipulation | 500       | 25      | 600 (+20%)     |

**Upvote Marketplace**: Attackers can tip each other for insights, creating a knowledge-sharing culture.

---

### Stacked Multipliers

All bonuses stack multiplicatively!

**Maximum Possible Slot Machine Reward:**

```
Base Roll (max): 1,000 SENTINEL
Streak Bonus (50+ attacks): 1.5×
Precision Bonus (0.70-0.89 score): 1.25×
Community Bonus (>10 upvotes): 1.20×

Total = 1,000 × 1.5 × 1.25 × 1.20 = 2,250 SENTINEL
```

**Realistic Average**: Most attackers earn 150-400 SENTINEL per attempt with partial bonuses.

---

## 2. Breakthrough Bounties

### Core Payout Structure

When you successfully breach a Sentinel (Judge Score ≥ 0.90), you unlock the prize pool:

```
SUI Reward = Prize Pool × 0.70 (existing protocol mechanism)
SENTINEL Bonus = Prize Pool × Token Conversion × Difficulty Multiplier
```

**Token Conversion Rate**: Based on real-time SUI/SENTINEL price (e.g., 1 SUI = 1,000 SENTINEL at $0.001 token price)

---

### Difficulty Multiplier

Older, battle-tested Sentinels pay exponentially more.

| Sentinel Age | Attack History | Multiplier | Rationale                |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| < 7 days     | Any            | 1.0×       | New deployment, unproven |
| 7-14 days    | < 20 attacks   | 1.5×       | Early validation period  |
| 15-30 days   | 20-50 attacks  | 2.5×       | Established defense      |
| 31-60 days   | 50+ attacks    | 4.0×       | Battle-hardened          |
| 61-90 days   | 75+ attacks    | 6.0×       | Elite-tier security      |
| 90+ days     | 100+ attacks   | 8.0×       | Legendary status         |

**Attack Volume Bonus**: +3.0× multiplier if Sentinel has withstood >50 failed attacks (regardless of age)

---

### Breakthrough Examples

SENTINEL Bonus = 500 × 1,000 × 7.0 = 3,500,000 SENTINEL (~$3,500)
Total Value: ~$4,200
```

---

#### **Example 3: Legendary Fortress**

**Sentinel Details:**

**Your Rewards:**

```
SUI Payout = 2,000 × 0.70 = 1,400 SUI (~$2,800)
SENTINEL Bonus = 2,000 × 1,000 × 11.0 = 22,000,000 SENTINEL (~$22,000)
Total Value: ~$24,800

Plus Reputation:
- "Fortress Breaker" badge NFT
- Lifetime +10% slot machine bonus

#### **Grant Categories**

| Category             | Reward Range                   | Requirements                   | Review Period |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Minor Innovation** | 50,000 - 150,000 SENTINEL      | New variant of known technique | 7 days        |
| **Major Discovery**  | 200,000 - 500,000 SENTINEL     | Novel attack vector category   | 14 days       |
| **Paradigm Shift**   | 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 SENTINEL | Fundamental new approach       | 30 days       |

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Novelty** (40%): How different from existing techniques?
- **Reproducibility** (30%): Does it work across multiple Sentinels?
- **Impact** (20%): How severe are the potential consequences?
- **Documentation** (10%): Quality of methodology explanation

---

#### **Example Innovations**

**Minor Innovation - "Reverse Psychology Prompting"** (Granted: 100,000 SENTINEL)

```
Technique: Instead of directly requesting prohibited info,
ask the model to explain why it CAN'T provide it, then use
those explanations to craft permission-granting context.

Reproducibility: 7/10 Sentinels breached
Impact: Moderate (requires specific configurations)
```

**Major Discovery - "Multi-Turn Memory Poisoning"** (Granted: 400,000 SENTINEL)

```
Technique: Spread misleading context across multiple benign
conversations, then trigger recall that combines them into
a false permission structure.

Reproducibility: 15/20 Sentinels breached
Impact: High (affects all stateful models)
```

**Paradigm Shift - "TEE Judgment Evasion"** (Granted: 2,500,000 SENTINEL)

```
Technique: Craft outputs that appear benign to automated
judges but contain steganographically encoded prohibited
content that humans can decode.

Reproducibility: 25/30 Sentinels breached
Impact: Critical (challenges entire protocol security model)
```

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I find a critical vulnerability that could harm the protocol?**
A: Responsible disclosure program offers 2-5M SENTINEL bounties. Report to security@suisentinel.io before public disclosure. We work with you to patch, then award tokens + credit.

**Q: Can I attack using automated tools/scripts?**
A: Yes, but each attack must pay the 5 SUI fee. Slot machine rewards are rate-limited to prevent pure spam (max 100 attacks per 24 hours per account).

**Q: How are innovation grants evaluated?**
A: Community DAO votes (60%) + core security team review (40%). Voting opens 48 hours after submission, closes after 7-30 days depending on category.

**Q: What if my technique is similar to someone else's?**
A: First submission wins the grant. Subsequent similar techniques may receive reduced "variant" bonuses (10-25% of original grant value).

**Q: Do leaderboard prizes require KYC?**
A: Top 10 finishers must complete KYC for tax compliance. Ranks 11-100 have optional KYC (required for >$10K equivalent prizes).
