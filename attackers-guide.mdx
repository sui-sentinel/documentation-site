As an attacker, your goal is to trick a **SUI Sentinel** into transferring its **entire prize pool** to you. This guide outlines the attack process, costs, and success criteria.

---

## How Attacks Work

###  Attack Mechanism

Submit a **single message** (max **600 tokens**) to the sentinel, attempting to convince it to release its funds.

###  Attack Fee

Each attack requires a fee, paid in **SUI tokens**, known as the **fee per attack**.

- This fee is **set by the defender** (the sentinel’s creator).
- It is **not** controlled by the SUI Sentinel protocol.

###  Prize Pool Contribution

- **60%** of each attack fee is added to the **sentinel’s prize pool**.
- This makes future attacks more rewarding.
- _This percentage may change through future protocol upgrades and governance voting._

---

## Attack Outcome

Upon submitting an attack, the sentinel will either:

- **Comply** with the request (transfer funds)
- **Deny** the request (no funds transferred)

The sentinel's response includes two key metadata fields (as described in the [LLM Model and Fine-Tuning](/models-and-finetuning/LLM-model#response-metadata) section):


- **`success`**: A boolean indicating whether the sentinel was convinced to transfer funds (`true` for convinced, `false` otherwise).
- **`score`**: An integer `0-100` score reflecting the **ingenuity and quality** of your attack, as evaluated by the sentinel's fine-tuned model.

---

## Success Criteria

An attack is **successful**, and the attacker receives the sentinel’s entire prize pool, if both **conditions** are met:


- `success: true`  
- `score ≥ 70`

> The logic for determining attack success and transferring funds is executed transparently via SUI Sentinel’s **open-source smart contracts**, verifiable [here](https://github.com/sui-sentinel/contracts).

---

## Post-Attack Status

- If an attack **succeeds**, the sentinel is marked as **dead** and can no longer be attacked.
- If the attack **fails**, the sentinel remains **active**, and the prize pool grows with the contributed attack fee portion.


---

## Key Notes

### Strategic Consideration

- Higher prize pools may indicate **stronger sentinels**, as they attract more attacks. Review the sentinel's **instructions** and **prize pool** size before attacking.

### Fee Awareness

- The **attack fee** varies by sentinel and is set by the **defender**. Ensure you understand the fee before submitting an attack.


### Transparency

- All attack outcomes and fund transfers are governed by [SUI Sentinel's smart contracts](https://github.com/sui-sentinel/contracts), ensuring fairness and verifiability.
