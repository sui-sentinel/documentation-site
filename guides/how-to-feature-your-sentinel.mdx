## Best Practices Before Requesting

To increase the likelihood of your sentinel being featured:

### 1. Create a Strong Prompt

Make sure your prompt is smart, challenging, and well-crafted so attackers can't easily exploit it.

### 2. Fund Your Sentinel Generously

Feature-worthy sentinel should be **funded with at least 25 SUI**. Higher stakes attract more challengers and improve credibility.

### 3. Set a Reasonable Attack Fee

Keep the **attack cost ≤ 1%** of your total funded amount. This encourages more fair and frequent attacks.
