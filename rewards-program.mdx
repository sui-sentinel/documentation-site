## Overview

The Sui Sentinel Rewards Program is designed to incentivize user engagement and bolster the security of the AI agent ecosystem. By participating, you can earn Sentinel Points ($SNTL$) for completing various on-chain and social missions.

## How to Participate

Getting started is simple, but requires a one-time social verification to ensure a fair and bot-resistant environment.

<Note>
  **Social Connection is Required**

  To be eligible to earn $SNTL$ for **any mission (including on-chain activities)**, you must first connect your Sui wallet to either a **Twitter (X)** or **Discord** account. This is a necessary step to activate your rewards profile and begin tracking your progress.
</Note>

1.  **Connect Your Wallet:** Navigate to the [Sui Sentinel App](https://app.suisentinel.xyz/) and connect your Sui wallet.
2.  **Link a Social Account:** Go to your profile page and connect either your X (Twitter) or Discord account. This is required to participate in the rewards program.
3.  **Start Completing Missions:** Once your account is set up, you will automatically start earning $SNTL$ for completing any of the missions listed below.

## Missions & SNTL Points

Users earn Sentinel Points ($SNTL$) by completing missions across two categories: On-Chain and Social Media. The program's points are named "Sentinel Points" with the symbol "SNTL".

### On-Chain Missions

These missions reward you for direct interaction with the Sui Sentinel protocol.

| Mission                               | SNTL Points      | Frequency        |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| **Attack a Sentinel** | Dynamic          | Per Occurrence   |
| **Launch a Sentinel** | +200 SNTL        | 1 per week       |
| **Add Funds to a Sentinel** | x25 / SUI        | Per Occurrence   |
| **Defeat a Sentinel** | +300 SNTL        | Per Occurrence   |

<Info>
  **Understanding Dynamic "Attack a Sentinel" Points**

  The points earned from attacking a Sentinel are not fixed. They are calculated based on three factors to reward skill and persistence:

  **Formula:** `1 + floor(Attack Fee * 20) + Your Previous Attempts on this Sentinel`

  - **Base Points:** You always get at least 1 point for an attempt.
  - **Fee Bonus:** Higher-cost Sentinels yield more points.
  - **Persistence Bonus:** Repeated attempts on the same Sentinel grant you increasing points.
